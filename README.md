# Deutsche Bank Customer Churn Prediction End to End Analysis and Modeling
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for Deutsche Bank using supervised machine learning techniques. The objective is to identify customers likely to close their accounts so the bank can implement proactive retention strategies. The workflow includes data exploration, feature engineering, and the development of multiple classification models, including Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Each model is tuned and evaluated using cross-validation and relevant performance metrics, with results compared to determine the most effective approach for predicting churn and supporting customer retention initiatives.
